<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

During the pandemic it was a hassle to fill in college applications online. So this is a portal that helps students store all their data in one place and also interact with their counsellors.

## Greetings Note

Hello, I hope you like my attempt at solving a problem that I, and several other peers of mine faced. I tried to create an effective solution that I think is potentially scale to impact thousands of students across the world. I hope you like it

### Features:
* Allows students to store essays, activities, transcripts, recommendations, scores and everything related to college apps.
* Allows curation of college lists, deadlines. Can interact with counsellors smoothly.
* Has a counsellor side system as well. Allows for counsellors to have all their data in one place

Of course, this is just a preliminary version of the project. It's UI and features and subject to expansion and change.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
